My name is K Kulkarni. I am learning Full stack Web Development. I want to specialize in Web Development. 
I am learning web development because I like it. I also want to earn my bread and butter doing freelance web development jobs. 
I am working really hard for it. I am sure that one day I will become an extra-ordinary web developer. I really want to earn handsome money from my earned skills.
